\section{Abstract}


Social media platforms primarily generate revenue from the collection of user data and targeted advertising. This is why it is in their best interest to keep users engaged as long as possible. To do this, algorithms are designed to serve content to users that will keep them using the platform. Many of these algorithms purposefully serve content to users that is designed to trigger strong emotional responses. This is done to extend the time users spend on the platform and create a dependence. This often has a direct negative impact on the mental health and well being of users. The goal of this paper is to understand the tactics used by these platforms and uncover the harm it causes.
